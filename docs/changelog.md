Old site had archived on https://github.com/bGZo/hentai-daily/tree/v1.0

## 2024.01.21 ~ 2024.11.23 Project archived

Archived due to using [telegram RSS bot](https://github.com/Rongronggg9/RSS-to-Telegram-Bot). But I realised this is a black hell when all messages messed up. I have no time to read anyone.

And also RSS integrate with Logseq also brings much garbage messages, which [brother me a lot](https://bgzo.github.io/vault/weekly/1218-giving-up-logseq).

So I have to restart it.
