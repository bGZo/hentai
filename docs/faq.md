But something happened(admin was arrested), so some website like https://www.south-plus.net was no longer providered the Chinese version for galgame.

## Q: Why the resources card get 404 or error page?

:::danger
So if you cannot get the resource, try to sign up an account. Basically they're free and anonymity.
If somewhere or website ask you paying for, please don't trust them.
:::

The strategy for resources are different each other, depends on website's admin, some sites like http://gmgard.com need to be a user to browser their contents, some website like http://blog.reimu.net no longer provide the share links on blog, instead of their telegram channel.

If any website need an invited code, you could drop me a line for this. 

I would try my best to help you.
